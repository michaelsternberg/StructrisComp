A slightly modified copy of Martin Haye's **Structris**, an elegant Tetris-esque game
for the Apple II written in Applesoft BASIC. This version was created to 
support a Structris tournament held at Kansasfest 2013. 

The differences are:

  * Simple score added (1 point per row cleared - no bonus opportunities).
  * Play can progress beyond level 10 - your blip becomes less visible with every 10-level wave completed.
  * Removed (R)estart option.
